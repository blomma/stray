/**
 A NDRotator object is a visual control used to select one or two values from a continuous range of values. Rotator are always displayed as circular dials. An indicator, or thumb, notes the current value of the rotator and can be moved by the user to change the setting with a turning action and the choice of radius action as well for a second value.
 
 ### Subclassing Notes
 The NDRotator class is designed to be subclassed to change the appearance. NDRotator performs caching of it elements to allow for smooth animation on low power devices like the iPhone, the methods to override work with this caching so you do not have to reimplement this yourself.
 
 #### Methods to Override
 
 When subclassing NDRotator, there are only a handful of methods you need to override. NDRotator is designed to do as much as possible to implement you own rotator style control, it is based around a control made up of two parts which do not change appearance for changing values but instead the position of a thumb element changes with respect to the body of the control.
 if you need to, you can override any of the following methods in your NDRotator subclasses:
 
 - Initialization:
 initWithFrame:, initWithCoder: -Just like subclassing and <UIView> you may want to override the initialisation methods initWithFrame: and initWithCoder: to add the initialisation of you own properties.
 - Coding:
 initWithCoder:, encodeWithCoder: -If you want to add your own values to be encoded and decoded you will then have to override these two methods you should call the super implementation.
 - Drawing:
 drawBodyInRect:hilighted:, drawThumbInRect:hilighted: -you will need to override these two methods to change the appearance of Rotator's, unless you want to just modify the default look, for example you could just override drawThumbInRect:hilighted: if you just want to change the thumb but keep the same body, you do no want to call the super implementations in your implementations.
 bodyRect, thumbRect -If you override <drawBodyInRect:hilighted:> <drawThumbInRect:hilighted:>, you will need to override the corresponding rect property to give NDRotator information on how to calculating the thumb position.
 - Behaviour:
 setStyle: -This method is can be overriden if want to limit which styles are supported, for example, the <NDRotatorStyleDisc> style offten will not be appropriate, if you are the only user of your subclass, then this is not nessecary as you can choose to just not use it this way.
