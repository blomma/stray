* Move the clock face up a bit on iPhone 5, should make the thumb action easier.
* In the Tagview, maybe black as a background wasn’t so hot when you slide it, so I made it more white, well actually I made it really white. But it blends better now and that should count for something.
* Overall less dark colors everywhere, not sure what my obsession with black was, lovely color, but not for this app.
* Made it more intuitive what should happen next after you have created a Tag.
* Maybe a nice beautiful icon would have been better than just showing “b…” for deleting tags, but it is in there now.
* The overview didn’t refresh itself when coming back from a healthy nap, the time should be more freshtastic now.
* You can no longer select unnamed tags, at least give them a proper name before playing with them.
* Unnamed tags no longer show up in the filter views.
* Various fixes and tweaks.
