✓ Tweaked the design for how tags are presented, got rid of the default “— —“ look for tags and instead replaced it with a nice icon.

✓ As you might have noticed, the clock face has a orange arrow to indicate start and a blue arrow to indicate current elapsed time. That was a wee bit not intuitive(theres that word again), especially when you started to rotate them and they snapped back into different positions from where you left them. So it is with great pleasure i give you a redesign of how they work. The orange arrow now shows the minute of the hour when you started the timer and the blue arrow now shows the minute of the current  time. So say you start the timer at 12:51 then the orange arrow is pointing at minute 51 and as you time goes along, eventually turning to 12:54 the blue arrow will track that. So now when you rotate the arrows they will stay in the place where you leave them, isn’t it handy.
