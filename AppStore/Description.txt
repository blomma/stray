Stray is a way for you to keep track of how you spend your time, the thought being that it should be simple and easy to start a timer, tag it and be done.

Features:
• Create timers (a given)
• Sync timers to Dropbox
• Tag them as an easy way to remember what they were for (memories are a fickle thing)
• Overview of past timers
• Beautiful interface (or so the kitchen gnomes say)
• Swiping, so much swiping, also some touching, but mostly swiping
