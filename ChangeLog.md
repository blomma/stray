# Changes 1.1
* [design] Move the clock face up a bit on iPhone 5, should make the thumb action easier.
* [design] In the Tagview, maybe black as a background wasn’t so hot when you slide it, so I made it more white, well actually I made it really white. But it blends better now and that should count for something.
* [design] Overall less dark colors everywhere, not sure what my obsession with black was, lovely color, but not for this app.
* [bug] The overview didn’t refresh itself when coming back from a healthy nap, the time should be more fresh now.
